      <h2>Pan-African &amp; Transnational Feminism: Early Foundations</h2>

      <p id="note1">
        Pan-African and transnational feminism emerged from the shared experiences of Black women across Africa, the Caribbean,
        and the United States who recognized that their struggles were interconnected across borders. In the early twentieth century,
        Black women confronted racism, colonial domination, and gender inequality not as isolated issues but as overlapping systems
        shaping every aspect of life. Their activism, writing, and organizing laid the foundations for a feminist tradition rooted
        in collective liberation and international solidarity, a tradition that scholars now recognize as central to global feminist
        history.<a href="#ref1"><sup>1</sup></a>
      </p>

      <h2>African American Roots of Global Feminist Activism</h2>

      <p id="note2">
        In the United States, Black women played a formative role in building early international feminist networks. Through participation
        in global conferences, collaboration with activists abroad, and the use of international platforms to discuss racial injustice,
        they extended Black feminist thought beyond the U.S. context. Their work demonstrated that gender oppression could not be understood
        separately from race or global power structures.<a href="#ref2"><sup>2</sup></a> This early engagement established a transnational
        orientation that would shape later forms of Pan-African and diaspora-based feminist organizing.
      </p>

      <h2>Caribbean Women and Diasporic Internationalism</h2>

      <p id="note3">
        Caribbean women also contributed significantly to the development of transnational feminist and Pan-African thought. Their activism
        often grew from the region’s history of colonialism, migration, and diaspora identity. Caribbean intellectuals and organizers used
        writing, political mobilization, and cultural work to link women’s struggles to global movements against imperialism and racism.<a href="#ref3"><sup>3</sup></a>
        Their contributions helped connect Caribbean feminist activism to broader international debates and positioned the Caribbean as an
        essential site in the evolution of global Black feminist politics.<a href="#ref4"><sup>4</sup></a>
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        “Pan-African feminist traditions grew from African women’s own political, social, and intellectual
        frameworks—not from Western feminist models.”
      </blockquote>

      <h2>African Women and Anti-Colonial Feminist Networks</h2>

      <p id="note4">
        On the African continent, women mobilized across ethnic and national boundaries to challenge colonial rule and advocate for political
        rights. Their organizing—through protests, associations, and international conferences—integrated feminist concerns into broader
        anti-colonial struggles. These efforts highlighted how colonialism reshaped gender systems and contributed to gendered forms of
        economic, political, and social control.<a href="#ref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Later African feminist scholars further articulated these ideas,
        showing how African perspectives enrich global feminist theory and Pan-African political thought.<a href="#ref6"><sup>6</sup></a>
      </p>

      <h2>Why These Origins Matter</h2>

      <p>
        From the outset, Pan-African and transnational feminism operated through cross-border networks that linked cities and movements
        across the Atlantic and the African continent. Through conferences, political travel, journalism, community organizations, and
        correspondence, Black women created a global map of feminist resistance that connected Harlem, Lagos, Kingston, Accra, Port of Spain,
        Cairo, and London. These origins reveal a shared commitment to resisting racism, colonialism, and gender oppression as intertwined
        global forces. This foundation sets the stage for the next section of your website, which highlights the key figures who shaped and
        advanced this global feminist tradition.
