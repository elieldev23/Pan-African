      <h2>Origins of Pan-African Feminism</h2>

      <p id="note2">
        Pan-African feminism grew from a shared experience of colonialism and the determination of African women
        to organize across borders in pursuit of self-determination. As Amina Mama explains, African feminist
        activism has always been transnational because “the divisions separating African women are artificial,
        created by colonial boundaries.”&nbsp;<a href="#ref2"><sup>²</sup></a>
      </p>

      <p>
        Women recognized early on that their liberation struggles were related. They participated in anti-colonial
        movements, conferences, and organizations that connected African, Caribbean, and African American activists.
        Through these networks, they began articulating ideas that linked gender equality, racial justice, and the
        fight against imperial domination.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        “Pan-African feminist traditions grew from African women’s own political, social, and intellectual
        frameworks—not from Western feminist models.”
      </blockquote>

      <p id="note3">
        Ifi Amadiume emphasizes the depth of this internal organizing, arguing that African women “did not wait for
        liberation from the outside; they created it from within the structures of their own societies.”&nbsp;
        <a href="#ref3"><sup>³</sup></a>
        This shows that Pan-African feminist traditions grew from African women’s own political, social, and
        intellectual frameworks—not from Western feminist models.
      </p>

      <p id="note4">
        Historian Imaobong D. Umoren also notes that early Black women activists across the Caribbean and Britain
        displayed an “internationalist consciousness.”&nbsp;<a href="#ref4"><sup>⁴</sup></a>
        This insight helps place African women’s activism within a broader global movement led by Black women who
        understood their freedom as interconnected across continents.
