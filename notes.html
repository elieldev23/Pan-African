      <h2>Researcher’s Note</h2>

      <p>
        <em>
          As an African woman studying international relations, learning about the long history of Pan-African and
          transnational Black feminist activism has deeply shaped my understanding of solidarity and resistance.
          These women across the United States, the Caribbean, and Africa built networks long before globalization,
          relying on letters, conferences, and collective courage to connect their struggles.
          Their stories remind me that the fight for gender equality, racial justice, and decolonization does not
          belong to one region — it is a shared legacy that crosses oceans.
          <br><br>
          Their determination inspires my own commitment to education, diplomacy, and community work, because I
          believe that African and African American women today continue to carry powerful voices that can transform
          societies. The future of Pan-African and transnational feminism depends on our ability to keep building
          bridges between continents, movements, and generations — and to ensure that young Black women are not just
          included, but leading the conversations about justice and liberation.
