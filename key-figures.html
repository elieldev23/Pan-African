      <h2>Key Figures and Their Contributions</h2>

      <p id="note5">
        <strong>Una Marson</strong> was a Jamaican poet, journalist, and activist whose work linked the Caribbean,
        Britain, and Africa. Historian Imaobong Umoren writes that Marson and her contemporaries expressed an
        “internationalist consciousness” in the 1930s.&nbsp;<a href="#ref5"><sup>⁵</sup></a>
      </p>

      <p id="note6">
        Marson herself insisted that “the status of women in our colonies must be raised if we are to speak of
        progress,” a statement showing her belief that gender equality was impossible without dismantling colonial
        power.&nbsp;<a href="#ref6"><sup>⁶</sup></a>
      </p>

      <p id="note7">
        <strong>Ifi Amadiume</strong>, a Nigerian anthropologist, challenged Western categories by examining
        indigenous African gender systems. Her research documented societies where gender roles were flexible or
        nonbinary before colonial rule. She argued that African feminist analysis must be rooted in African histories
        and “voicing feminisms” through local epistemologies.&nbsp;<a href="#ref7"><sup>⁷</sup></a>
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        “African feminism is not an imitation of Western models; it is grounded in the specific histories and
        struggles of African women.”
      </blockquote>

      <p id="note8">
        <strong>Amina Mama</strong> has been central to articulating feminist thought in relation to Pan-African
        liberation. She argues that feminism in Africa is deeply connected to the continent’s political struggles,
        writing that African feminist work is part of “the continuing struggles for self-determination.”&nbsp;
        <a href="#ref8"><sup>⁸</sup></a>
      </p>

      <p>
        In the United States, <strong>Mary Church Terrell</strong> became a foundational internationalist figure.
        Her lifelong motto, used throughout the National Association of Colored Women, was “Lifting as we climb,”
        reflecting the collective commitment of Black women’s activism.
      </p>

      <p id="note9">
        Likewise, <strong>Addie Hunton</strong> took part in international peace and women’s conferences; scholars
        describe African American women like her as “true negotiators in the international arena.”&nbsp;
