      <h2>Key Figures in Pan-African &amp; Transnational Black Feminism</h2>

      <p id="note1">
        <strong>Addie Hunton</strong> was among the earliest African American women to engage directly in transnational political
        organizing. As a leader in international women’s and civil-rights organizations, she worked with entities such as the NAACP
        and the YWCA, and during World War I traveled to Europe to support Black soldiers and observe the global dimensions of racial
        oppression. Her transnational activism extended into interwar international peace work, and through her writings and organizing
        she linked racism in the United States with colonial oppression abroad, helping shape an early Black internationalist feminist
        consciousness.<a href="#ref1"><sup>1</sup></a>
      </p>

      <p id="note2">
        Hunton’s involvement in international women’s organizations demonstrated that Black women demanded a seat at global political
        tables, arguing that racial justice and gender justice must go hand in hand.<a href="#ref2"><sup>2</sup></a>
      </p>

      <p id="note3">
        <strong>Amy Ashwood Garvey</strong> co-founded the Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA) and played a central role
        in building Pan-African and diaspora networks across the Caribbean, the United States, and Europe. Through her leadership,
        she helped develop UNIA’s women’s wing and advocated for women’s rights within the broader anti-colonial, Black nationalist
        movement.<a href="#ref3"><sup>3</sup></a> In 1945, she helped organize the 5th Pan-African Congress in Manchester, where
        she emphasized that women’s equality was essential to African liberation, planting early seeds for transnational Black
        feminist politics. Her activism, rooted in both gender and racial justice, shaped a Pan-African vision inclusive of women’s
        liberation.
      </p>

      <p id="note4">
        As an anthropologist, journalist, and global activist, <strong>Eslanda Robeson</strong> travelled extensively across Africa in
        the 1930s and 1940s. Her book <em>African Journey</em> (1945) documented anti-colonial movements and drew attention to the
        political roles of African women, bridging African American experiences of racial oppression with African struggles for
        liberation.<a href="#ref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Robeson’s transnational activism and scholarship combined anti-racism,
        anti-colonialism, and feminist critique. Her work made clear that the fight for justice in the United States was intimately
        linked with liberation for colonized peoples abroad.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        “Pan-African feminist histories remind us that Black women have always organized across borders, imagining freedom beyond empire.”
      </blockquote>

      <p id="note5">
        <strong>Una Marson</strong> was a Jamaican poet, playwright, journalist, and social activist who became an internationally
        recognized feminist and Pan-Africanist in the 1930s. Between 1932 and 1936, she lived in London and became active in British
        and international women’s and Pan-African organizations. Marson’s experiences of racism and sexism in Britain shaped her
        evolving vision of Black feminism and internationalism.<a href="#ref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Her writing, activism, and engagement
        with global Black intellectual networks make her a foundational, though long overlooked, figure in transnational Black feminist
        history.
      </p>

      <p id="note6">
        Though often more recognized for her national civil-rights and suffrage work, <strong>Mary Church Terrell</strong> played a
        significant role in early international feminist and Black women’s activism. For instance, she was involved in the founding
        of the International Council of Women of the Darker Races (ICWDR), which sought to link women across the African diaspora,
        making her efforts an early form of transnational organizing among Black women.<a href="#ref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Her life and
        activism show that from as early as the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Black American women were thinking and
        acting internationally.
      </p>

      <p id="note7">
        As a pioneering African feminist scholar, <strong>Ifi Amadiume</strong> challenged Western assumptions about gender and gender
        relations. Through landmark works such as <em>Male Daughters, Female Husbands</em>, she documented flexible, pre-colonial
        gender systems in Igbo society, providing theoretical grounding for understanding African women’s agency beyond colonial and
        patriarchal frameworks.<a href="#ref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Although her writing began later (from the 1980s onward), Amadiume’s
        scholarship has been integral in connecting African feminist theory to global Black feminist debates, demonstrating the long
        intellectual lineage and continuous evolution of transnational feminist critique.
